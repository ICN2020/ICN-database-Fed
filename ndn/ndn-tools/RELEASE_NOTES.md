Release Notes
=============

## Version 0.4

**NOTE**

  As of version 0.4, NDN Essential Tools require a modern compiler (gcc >= 4.8.2, clang >= 3.4)
  and a relatively new version of the Boost libraries (>= 1.54).  This means that the code no
  longer compiles with the packaged version of gcc and Boost libraries on Ubuntu 12.04.
  NDN Essential Tools can still be compiled on such systems, but require a separate
  installation of a newer version of the compiler (e.g., clang-3.4) and dependencies.
