.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Retrieves the opaque id of the server used for the operation.

(The function name includes the old term "hint" for the sake of backward compatibility, but we now call this number a "server id".)

This number is zero until the driver actually uses a server when executing the find operation or
.B mongoc_cursor_set_hint
is called.
