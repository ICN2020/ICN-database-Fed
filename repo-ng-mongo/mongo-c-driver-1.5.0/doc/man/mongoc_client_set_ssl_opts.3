#ifdef MONGOC_ENABLE_SSL
mongoc_client_set_ssl_opts (mongoc_client_t        *client,

Sets the SSL options to use when connecting to SSL enabled MongoDB servers.

Beginning in version 1.2.0, once a client has any SSL options set, all connections use SSL, even if
.B ssl=true
is omitted from the MongoDB URI. Before, SSL options were ignored unless
.B ssl=true
was included in the URI.

The
.B mongoc_ssl_opt_t
struct is copied by the client along with the strings it points to (
.B pem_file
,
.B pem_pwd
,
.B ca_file
,
.B ca_dir
, and
.B crl_file
) so they don't have to remain valid after the call to
.B mongoc_client_set_ssl_opts
.

It is a programming error to call this function on a client from a
.B mongoc_client_pool_t
. Instead, call
.B mongoc_client_pool_set_ssl_opts
on the pool before popping any clients.
