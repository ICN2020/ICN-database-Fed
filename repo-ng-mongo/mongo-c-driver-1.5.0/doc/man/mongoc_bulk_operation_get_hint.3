.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Retrieves the opaque id of the server used for the operation.

(The function name includes the old term "hint" for the sake of backward compatibility, but we now call this number a "server id".)

This number is zero until the driver actually uses a server in
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute
. The server id is the same number as the return value of a successful
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute
, so
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_get_hint
is useful mainly in case
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute
fails and returns zero.
