.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Specifies which server to use for the operation. This function has an effect only if called before
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute
.

(The function name includes the old term "hint" for the sake of backward compatibility, but we now call this number a "server id".)

Use
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_set_hint
only for building a language driver that wraps the C Driver. When writing applications in C, leave the server id unset and allow the driver to choose a suitable server for the bulk operation.
