Threading \- None
Libbson's data structures are
.B NOT
thread\(hysafe. You are responsible for accessing and mutating these structures from one thread at a time.

Libbson requires POSIX threads (pthreads) on all UNIX\(hylike platforms. On Windows, the native threading interface is used. Libbson uses your system's threading library to safely generate unique
.B ObjectIds
, and to provide a fallback implementation for atomic operations on platforms without built\(hyin atomics.
